# 🌾 Smart Crop Recommendation Using Environmental and Soil Parameters

A Machine Learning–powered web application that predicts the **most suitable crop** based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), environmental factors (temperature, humidity, rainfall), and soil pH.  
This project aims to support **precision agriculture**, enabling farmers to make data-driven decisions and maximize productivity.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters soil and environmental values in the form  
2. Inputs are validated to stay within realistic limits  
3. Model predicts the best crop  
4. Crop name and its image are displayed on the result page  

The prediction pipeline is:
